## Common Misconceptions
1. **JavaScript is the same as Java**: Despite the similar names, JavaScript and Java are two completely different programming languages. They have different syntax, use cases, and capabilities.

2. **DOM is the same as HTML**: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. While HTML is used to create the DOM, the DOM is much more powerful and includes methods and properties to manipulate the document‚Äôs structure, style, and content.

3. **JavaScript is a simple language**: While it may seem simple at first, JavaScript is a powerful and complex language with many nuances and intricacies. It supports various programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented, event-driven) and has a lot of features that can be difficult to master.

4. **Using the DOM is the only way to manipulate a web page**: While the DOM is the most common way to manipulate a web page, it is not the only way. For example, you can also manipulate a web page using CSS and manipulate the DOM using libraries like jQuery or frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js.
