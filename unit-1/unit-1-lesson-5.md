## Key Points

- üëã Welcome & Do Now (10):
  - Begin by welcoming everyone and explaining the objectives of the lesson.
  - Ask participants to share their answers to the 'Do Now' questions and clarify any misconceptions.<br><br>
  
- ‚å®Ô∏è Event Handlers (10):
  - Explain that events are actions that can be detected by JavaScript, such as clicks, key presses, and page loads.
  - Define event handlers as special JavaScript functions that respond to events and make web pages interactive.
  - Use an analogy to explain event handlers, for example: "It‚Äôs kind of like a doorbell ringing when someone's at the door."
  - List common events, such as click events, key press events, mouse over events, and form submission events. <br><br>

- üíª Code Along (15):
  -  Share your screen and guide participants through a coding exercise that involves creating event handlers.
  - Start by declaring variables for HTML elements and explain the importance of the selector and event.
  - Use both HTML attributes (e.g., onclick) and the JavaScript addEventListener method to connect HTML elements to JavaScript functions.
  - Encourage participants to code along and ask questions.<br><br>

- ‚è≥ Break (10):<br><br>

- ü™≥ Debugging & Clean Code (10):
  - Discuss the importance of debugging and share debugging strategies, such as making things visible, slowing down the analysis, and testing code in chunks.
  - Emphasize the importance of clean code and discuss clean code best practices, such as meaningful naming conventions, declaring variables in the appropriate scope, and writing self-explanatory code.<br><br>

- üíª Project Intro & Planning (50)
  - Students will continue working on their projects.
  - They should continue filling out their planning documents if they haven't already.
  - Students will continue forward integrating HTMl/CSS/JS into their portfolios.

- üëã Closing (10):
  - Recap the key takeaways from the lesson.
  - Address any questions or concerns.<br><br>
  

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Confusing the DOM with HTML**: Some students might think that the DOM and the HTML of a page are the same things. It's important to clarify that the DOM is a live object-oriented representation of the web page which can be manipulated with JavaScript, whereas the HTML is just text.

2. **Thinking that JavaScript and the DOM are the same**: Some students might not understand that JavaScript is a language, and the DOM is an API (Application Programming Interface) for interacting with web pages. 

3. **Understanding Event Handlers**: Students might think that event handlers are a part of the JavaScript language itself, rather than functions that are called in response to events in the DOM.

4. **Debugging is about removing errors only**: Some students might think that debugging is only about removing errors, whereas it is a broader process that includes identifying, isolating, and fixing errors in the program.

5. **Writing Clean Code is not necessary**: Some students might underestimate the importance of writing clean, well-organized code. They might think that as long as the code works, it doesn't matter how it's written.

6. **Adding Event Listeners**: Students often forget to add event listeners to the DOM elements or add them incorrectly which results in no action on the event trigger.
