## Key Points

- üëã Welcome & Do Now (10):

- ‚ÜîÔ∏è JavaScript & HTML DOM (5):

    - Introduction to the `innerHTML` property.
  - Manipulating the DOM with Events:
    - Explain why it's beneficial to attach an event.
    - Highlight the steps for DOM Manipulation:
        1. Variables: store HTML elements.
        2. Event: what needs to happen to cause the change.
        3. Action: what will happen when the event is triggered.
