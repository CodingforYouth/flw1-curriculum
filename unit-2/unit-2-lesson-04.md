## Key Points

- üëã Welcome & Do Now (10) :
  - Use this time for students to come in and get ready.
  - Welcome students warmly and open the class agenda.
  - Prompt students to begin the 'Do Now' activity related to arrays.<br><br>
  
- üì¶‚û∞ for loops (15) :
  - Introduction to for loops as a method to iterate code based on set parameters.
  - Discuss the syntax and components of a for loop with examples.
  - Highlight initialization (setting a starting point for loop counter), condition (determining how many times to run the loop), and afterthought (updating loop counter‚Äôs value).
  - Emphasize the importance of including a condition or a break to prevent infinite loops.
  - Explain the significance of .length and the importance of initializing counters at zero.<br><br>

- üíª Code Along (15) :
  - Instruct students to open the js file.
  - Lead students through coding exercises, helping them practice for loops in JavaScript.<br><br>

- ‚ûø forEach loops (15) :
  - Introduce forEach loops as a way to iterate through array elements without needing to provide settings as in for loops.- Go through the syntax and components of forEach loops with examples.
  - Discuss when and why one might choose to use forEach loops over for loops.<br><br>

- üíª Code Solo (10) :
  - Allow students time to practice coding with loops independently.<br><br>

- ‚è≥ Break (10):<br><br>

- üíª Project Work Time (35) :
  - Guide students through the task for the day.
      - Loop through arrays and display data to the correct divs, using appropriate HTML tags for images, song names, artists, and song links.
  - Support and assist students as they work on their projects.<br><br>

- üëã Exit Ticket & Closing (10):
  - Recap the key takeaways from the lesson.
  - Address any questions or concerns.
  - Direct students to the exit ticket in the Class Agenda and ensure they complete it.
  - Double check and ensure all students have submitted their exit ticket.<br><br>
