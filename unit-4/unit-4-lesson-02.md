## Key Points

- üëã Welcome & Do Now (10) :
  - Use this time for students to come in and get ready.
  - Welcome students warmly and open the class agenda.
  - Prompt students to think about their favorite app/website considering its interactions with other apps/websites, data sharing mechanisms, and the implications of these interactions..<br><br>
  
- ‚ÜîÔ∏è APIs (15) :
  - Explain what APIs are, their role in enabling applications to exchange data, and provide examples of popular APIs.
  - Discuss the analogy of an API to a restaurant menu to illustrate how APIs work - detailing the process from making a request to receiving a response.
  - Highlight the use of APIs to fetch data for their MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
  - Guide students in planning their projects, considering the APIs they might use or the data they might need to create in a db.json file.<br><br>

- üíª Code Along, Part 1 (15) :
  - Use the PokeAPI to demonstrate how to fetch data from an API.
  - Students follow along, writing code to fetch and log data from the API.
  - Emphasize understanding the structure of the API and navigating its documentation.<br><br>

- ‚è≥ Break (10) <br><br>

- Code Along, Part 2 (15) :
 - Demonstrate fetching data from a custom API (example: a database of cat facts).
 - Encourage students to drive the coding process, with the instructor providing guidance on accessing and displaying data.

- üíª Project Work Time (35) :
  - Students work on their projects, applying the concepts learned in the lesson.
  - The instructor and volunteers provide support, answering questions and offering guidance.
  - Encourage students to explore free APIs for their projects or to start creating their custom API if needed.<br><br>

- üëã Exit Ticket & Closing (10) :
  - Recap the key takeaways from the lesson.
  - Address any questions or concerns.
  - Direct students to the exit ticket in the Class Agenda and ensure they complete it.
  - Double check and ensure all students have submitted their project progress.<br><br>
