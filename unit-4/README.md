## Work Products Overview

The Client Project is a culminating project that incorporates all of the skills that have been taught in the course and is intended to highlight some important aspects of goal setting, project management, collaboration and presentation.

Students will have to create a new website from scratch and implement an API in their project so that their website is functional.

As their final project, this unit should be as student-driven as possible. If time allows, give students the space to brainstorm and create their own designs (with you there as support to ensure that their project is feasible).
